        <p>
          Mekanism adds a few ores to the mix, but the most important one is Osmium ore.
          Though brittle in real life, this is the key metal in Mekanism crafting alongside Iron.
          It is recommended to collect a lot of it throughout your trip to the mines.
          Once you’re set up and ready to start, the first step is to get some basic machines up and running.
          These machines will enable you to make key crafting components for the rest of the
          modded links and machinery.

        <p>
          Assuming you don’t have any other mods installed, the first thing we’re going to make is the
          Heat Generator. If this isn’t showing up in your Creative Menu or JEI, perhaps you missed the add-on
          mod,<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism-generators" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" id="bluetext">Mekanism: Generators.</a>If you do have other mods
          installed or are using a modpack, the power systems are generally interchangeable.
          You can plug in your machines to a pre-existing power source or make beginner generators from other
          mods to substitute Mekanism’s.
